Data structures and Algorithms are a crucial part of programming. This repository is just an approach to gather all the algorithms i learnt at one place. It is just a list of standard codes which are available over all leading coding platforms like <a href="https://geeksforgeeks.org"> gfg <a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com"> leetcode</a>. Have a look at these codes, if you find them useful, you can star the repository too ;) . There is a small executable file run_me too, you can simply run it for fun.
